## **Introduction**

This repository is meant for anyone looking to start their Python programming journey or those who want to advance their skills. We start from basic programming concepts like variables and arithmetic operations, and work our way up to advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.

Each section is filled with clear explanations, code examples, and exercises to practice your skills.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Basic understanding of using a computer
- No prior programming knowledge is required

### **Installing Python**
Before you start, you will need Python installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### **Recommended IDEs**
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
